The system for determing crime penalty.

## Scripts
*(Just in case)* The essensial is to **install** dependencies first. Then and only then you can **run** client or server (or them both).

### Deps scripts
- `npm run install-deps` to instal both client and server dependencies
- `npm run install-server-deps` to instal only server dependencies
- `npm run install-client-deps` to instal only client dependencies

### Run scripts
- `npm start` to launch both client and server
- `npm run run-server` to launch server
- `npm run run-client` to launch client

### Server env variables
- `Port` - the port app should be listening on
- `DbConnection` - mongoDB connection string
- `Secret` - secret string used in signing sid-cookie
- `RedisPort` - port on which redis-server runs
